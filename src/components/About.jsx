            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
                Greetings, I'm Dan Spelt, a seasoned full-stack web developer with over 18 years of experience in crafting robust, scalable, and user-centric applications. My extensive journey in the tech industry is a testament to my skills, determination, and ability to overcome challenges.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-red-900">Living with Cerebral Palsy</h3>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
                Born with cerebral palsy, a condition affecting muscle coordination and mobility, I have faced unique challenges throughout my life. However, this has never hindered my passion for technology or my ability to excel in web development. Instead, it has fueled my drive to innovate and find creative solutions to complex problems. My condition has instilled in me resilience, adaptability, and a profound understanding of the importance of accessibility in technologyâ€”skills that are integral to my work as a developer.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-red-900">Professional Perspective on Accessibility</h3>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
                My cerebral palsy does not define my professional capabilities. It has provided me with a unique perspective on accessibility and inclusivity, which I incorporate into every project. I have developed tools and techniques to optimize my work environment for productivity. My expertise in accessible design is not just theoretical; it is born out of personal experience. I understand the importance of creating websites and applications that are accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
                I have led the development of several high-impact projects, including a Next.js app designed to enhance device accessibility and a comprehensive visualization dashboard using the MERN stack. My ability to collaborate with cross-functional teams, coupled with my technical expertise, has consistently resulted in the successful delivery of projects that meet both business and user needs.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-red-900">Commitment to Accessibility and Diversity</h3>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
                My commitment to accessibility extends beyond compliance; it is about creating genuinely inclusive experiences. I have implemented WCAG 2.0 standards in various projects, resulting in improved accessibility compliance and enhanced user experiences for individuals with disabilities. Additionally, I have spearheaded diversity initiatives that have led to increased applications from underrepresented groups, further contributing to an inclusive tech environment.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-red-900">Why Collaborate with Me?</h3>
